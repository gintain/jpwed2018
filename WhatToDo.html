<h1 align="center"><font face="palatino"></font>What To Do</h1>
<p>There is plenty to see and do within 2 hours driving distance of Jay.</p>
<h1>Burlington, VT</h1>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8257/29532371015_eedf0fce24_k.jpg"><img style="float:right;padding:2px" src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8257/29532371015_eedf0fce24_k.jpg" alt="Burlington" width="300" height="200"></a>
The largest city in Vermont (at about 42,250), Burlington is situated on Lake Champlain and is about
1.5 hours from Jay. Church Street Marketplace is a pedestrian street with many options for shopping
and dining. A placard on the ground gives homage to the now-closed original Ben and Jerry's ice cream store. 
A short walk toward the lake leads to sweeping views of the Adirondacks across the lake.
Look for College Street to descend to Waterfront Park and get closer to the lake. Head further south 
to Shelburne to see some unique attractions, such as the Vermont Teddy Bear Factory and the Shelburne Museum,
which contains a unique collection of structures preserved from around the state. Shelburne Vineyard is 
a nice place to relax for some wine. Speaking of wine, head north toward South Hero for more vineyards and
to launch your exploration of Lake Champlain.</p>
<h1>Montreal, QC</h1>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5560/14932123576_b4537dccb7_k.jpg"><img style="float:left;padding:2px;" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5560/14932123576_b4537dccb7_k.jpg" alt="Montreal" width="300" height="200"></a>
Just 1.75 hours and a border crossing away, Montreal offers a chance to experience another continent 
in another country. Among some of the sights not to miss are Rue St-Denis, with its European architecture and 
plentiful restaurants, Basilique Notre-Dame, a  the Olympic Stadium, built for the 1976 Olympics, and Mont Royal,
hills that tower over Montreal and offer expansive views. If you have no qualms regarding your health, 
try poutine, a quintessential Quebecois dish comprising french fries, cheese curds, and gravy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Woodstock, VT</h1>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8609/28229913562_20177e1421_k.jpg"><img style="float:right;padding:2px" src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8609/28229913562_20177e1421_k.jpg" alt="Woodstock" width="300" height="200"></a>
Two hours south of Jay, VT, is the town of Woodstock, VT. There is a surprising amount of to do in 
this incredibly cute New England town. Billings Farm and Museum offers a feel for how a 19th century farm 
operated. Across the street is the only member of the US National Park System in Vermont, the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller 
National Historical Park. More history can be learned here as well as an extensive hike up to Mount Tom. The center of 
Woodstock has historic architecture and can easily be explored on foot. Nearby in Quechee, the Vermont Institute of 
Natural Science is home to injured raptors, including various species of owls.</p>
<h1>Vermont</h1>
<p><a target="blank" href="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4437/36828998292_d59d701791_k.jpg"><img style="float:left;padding:2px" src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4437/36828998292_d59d701791_k.jpg" alt="Vermont" width="300" height="200"></a>
Other places in Vermont worth visiting include the state capital, Montpelier, which is about 1.5 hours away. 
The least populous state capital (a little more than 7,000 full-time residents), Montpelier is easily navigated. 
The Ben and Jerry's Factory in Waterbury is a unique attraction that can be toured (don't forget the graveyard 
of flavors past). Mount Mansfield is the state's highest point and is a challenging hike rewarded with majestic 
views (that is, if the clouds cooperate). Nearby Camel Hump State Park is also great for hiking (of note are the 
remains of a B-24J bomber that crashed in 1944). And virtually every town has an idyllic center with a general 
store and maple sugarhouse nearby.</p>
